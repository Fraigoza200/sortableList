# sortableList
Creating this application allowed me to practice my skills in Javascript. Utilizing an API that returns some of the wealthiest persons in the world, this application allows users to sort any person in a 1 to 10 scale.
If the sorting of the persons is incorrect, the names of the people will turn red, and if they are sorted correctly, they'll turn green.
